A 3D-printed enclosure that transforms your Steam Deck into a compact, portable laptop.

This project provides a custom-designed enclosure that securely holds both the **Steam Deck** and the **Logitech K380 keyboard**. The dimensions line up perfectly, allowing the two devices to nest together as if they were meant for each other. The result is a clean, lightweight, and highly portable laptop-style setup you can take anywhere.
